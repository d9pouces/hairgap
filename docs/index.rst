Hairgap's documentation
=======================

Introduction
------------

Basic protocol to send files using the [hairgap binary](https://github.com/cea-sec/hairgap).
The goal is to send random files through a unidirectionnal data-diode using UDP connections.

By default, hairgap can only send a file, without its name. This library implements a basic protocol to send complete directories
and checksum transfered files.

This protocol is customizable and the sender side can add some attributes to each transfer.


* We assume that the hairgap binary is installed and in the PATH environment variable.
* The MAC adress of the destination must be known from the sender machine. You can inject this information into the ARP cache of the sender machine:


.. code-block:: bash

   DESTINATION_IP="the IP address of the destination machine"
   DESTINATION_MAC="the MAC address of the destination machine"
   arp -s ${DESTINATION_IP} ${DESTINATION_MAC}

Command-line usage
------------------

First, you must start the receiver on the destination side:


.. code-block:: bash

   pip3 install hairgap
   pyhairgap receive ${DESTINATION_IP} directory/


Then you can send directories:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip3 install hairgap
   pyhairgap send ${DESTINATION_IP} directory/

You must ensure that only one transfer occurs at once (to a given port), due to UDP limitations.

How does it work?
-----------------

- First, an index file is created beside the directory to send, with the relative path of each file, their sizes and SHA256s.
   If a file is empty, this file is replaced by a magic value (since hairgap cannot send empty files).
   If a file starts by some magic values, then this file is overwritten to escape these magic values.
   The content of the directory to send is **modified in-place**.

- When all files are checked and the index file is ready, the transfer of the index file occurs, then each file is sent.
   There is a 3-second sleep between two successive transfers.

- On the receiver side, there are two infinite loops:

   - one for the reception thread, that receives a file and sends it to the processing thread
   - one for the processing thread, that process each file (if its an index, then it reads it and knows how to rename the next files)

Unexpected files (for example, if the index file has been sent before the start of the receive process) are deleted.

Customize transfers
-------------------

The configuration (with destination IP, `hairgap`'s options, destination pathsâ€¦) is stored into a :mod

.. py:class:: hairgap.utils.Config
